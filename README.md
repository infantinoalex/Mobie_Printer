# Description

This repository contains code for the Mobile Robotics I Final Project that is offered at UMass Lowell.

# Summary

There are currently two sub folders. One labeled Working and one Not Working.

The Working folder contains the code that was demonstrated during our demo. This code is very simplistic, but it works.

The Not Working folder contains code that was ambitious, but ultimately was not working for the demo
